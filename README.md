## A student-first learning platform, built for areas with weak internet and real challenges.

## ✨ Vision

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, I (the founder) was still young and found platforms like Microsoft Teams hard to use and slow. In 2023, a war broke out in Gaza and disconnected us from school for more than a year.

That’s when I asked:

> **“Why aren’t we building something made for students?”**

So I decided to build one — with you.
